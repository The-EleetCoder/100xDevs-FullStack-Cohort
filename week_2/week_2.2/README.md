## What is ECMAScript
ECMAScript is a standardized specification for scripting languages, originally developed to standardize JavaScript. It defines the syntax, semantics, and behavior that JavaScript (and other languages like JScript and ActionScript) should adhere to. ECMAScript versions (e.g., ES5, ES6/ES2015, ES7, etc.) correspond to different updates and additions to the language specification.

## What is JavaScript
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic websites. However, with the advent of Node.js, it is now also used for server-side development, desktop applications, and even mobile applications. JavaScript is the most widely used implementation of ECMAScript and is supported by all major browsers.

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine, which powers Google Chrome. It provides a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server-side, rather than just in the browser. Traditionally, JavaScript was primarily used for client-side scripting in web browsers. Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities to enable server-side scripting, allowing developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript
