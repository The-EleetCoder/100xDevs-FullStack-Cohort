### 1. Why Languages?
Firstly, lets understand how applications run in our computer. All the applications reside in our SSD. But when we double click on any application, it goes into ram. And by 'it', i mean the 0s and 1s and not any c++ code or java code. This is because the computer only understands 0s and 1s.  And its not human to write the code in 0s & 1s. Thats why we require these high level languages to write our code, which is then coverter to the machine level code by something known as a compiler.
